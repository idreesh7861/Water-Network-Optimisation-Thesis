The effective planning of water distribution infrastructure is critical to sustainable urban development and the reconstruction of conflict zones around the world, yet current approaches often suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and inadequate scalability. This paper presents the design and implementation of a software tool for optimising water distribution systems using a flow-based model, focusing on minimising installation costs whilst satisfying pressure constraints. The research undertaken formulates the optimisation problem as a Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) model. A grid-based modelling approach allows the system to simulate physical layout constraints. The project demonstrates the successful use of MIP to solve a non-trivial infrastructure problem, offering a scalable and flexible approach to water utility planning. The results confirm the system produces valid and efficient solutions and can be further expanded to incorporate regulatory constraints and additional physical factors in future work.
