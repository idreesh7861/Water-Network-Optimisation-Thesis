Distribution systems\u2014consisting of pipes, pumps, valves, storage tanks, reservoirs, meters, fittings, and other hydraulic appurtenances\u2014carry drinking water from a centralized treatment plant or well supplies to consumers' taps. Spanning almost 1 million miles in the United States, distribution systems represent the vast majority of physical infrastructure for water supplies, and thus constitute the primary management challenge from both an operational and public health standpoint. Recent data on waterborne disease outbreaks suggest that distribution systems remain a source of contamination that has yet to be fully addressed. This report evaluates approaches for risk characterization and recent data, and it identifies a variety of strategies that could be considered to reduce the risks posed by water-quality deteriorating events in distribution systems. Particular attention is given to backflow events via cross connections, the potential for contamination of the distribution system during construction and repair activities, maintenance of storage facilities, and the role of premise plumbing in public health risk. The report also identifies advances in detection, monitoring and modeling, analytical methods, and research and development opportunities that will enable the water supply industry to further reduce risks associated with drinking water distribution systems.",

    ABSTRACT = {Modern water distribution networks (WDNs) are complex and difficult to manage due to increased level of urbanization, varying consumer demands, ageing infrastructure, operational costs, and inadequate water resources. The management problems in such complex networks may be classified into short-term, medium-term, and long-term, depending on the duration at which the problems are solved or considered. To address the management problems associated with WDNs, mathematical models facilitate analysis and improvement of the performance of water infrastructure at minimum operational cost, and have been used by researchers, water utility managers, and operators. This paper presents a detailed review of the management problems and essential mathematical models that are used to address these problems at various phases of WDNs. In addition, it also discusses the main approaches to address these management problems to meet customer demands at the required pressure in terms of adequate water quantity and quality. Key challenges that are associated with the management of WDNs are discussed. Also, new directions for future research studies are suggested to enable water utility managers and researchers to improve the performance of water distribution networks.},

@article{Zhou2022,
   abstract = {The upgrading of water supply services is calling for more accurate and adaptive numerical models to give insight into actual water distribution systems (WDSs), which underlines the importance of carefully calibrating model parameters. Due to unavoidable uncertainties in the calibration process such as measurement errors, errors in model parameters assumed to be known, and local-optimum of calibration algorithms, calibrated parameters could still contain non-negligible latent errors, and the calibrated model may not able to maintain its long-term accuracy when operating conditions change. To solve this problem, there is growing interest in adopting data assimilation (DA) methods to utilize more comprehensive information in long-term measurements to reduce the impact of uncertainties and maintain the accuracy and stability of calibrated models. In this study, two traditional calibration methods and four DA methods were tested and compared in two WDSs with different structures, which aims to form a general understanding of the behavior and applicability of different methods. The calibration results show that DA methods perform better than traditional methods and are more robust to different types of uncertainties, which provide an effective way to maintain the long-term accuracy of WDS models to enable better management of WDSs. Ensemble-based DA methods such as Particle Filter (PF) and Inferential-Measurement Kalman Filter (IMKF) performed well in the real-life system. They avoid linear approximation and can better estimate the impact of uncertainties to assimilate accurate correction information of the parameters. Gradient-based DA methods such as Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Variational Bayesian Adaptive Kalman Filter (VBAKF) have lower computational demand, but they are found to be less robust when dealing with large system uncertainties and nonlinearities.},

   abstract = {Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has become a cornerstone of operations research. This is driven by the enhanced efficiency of modern solvers, which can today find globally optimal solutions within seconds for problems that were out of reach a decade ago. The versatility of these solvers allowed successful applications in many areas, such as transportation, logistics, supply chain management, revenue management, finance, telecommunications, and manufacturing. Despite the impressive success already obtained, many challenges remain, and MILP is still a very active field. This article provides an overview of the most significant results achieved in advancing the MILP solution methods. Given the immense literature on this topic, we made deliberate choices to focus on computational aspects and recent practical performance improvements, emphasizing research that reports computational experiments. We organize our survey into three main parts, dedicated to branch-and-cut methods, Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition, and Benders decomposition. The paper concludes by highlighting ongoing challenges and future opportunities in MILP research.},

abstract = {The Generalized Travelling Salesman Problem, denoted by GTSP, is a variant of the classical travelling salesman problem (TSP), in which the nodes of an undirected graph are partitioned into node sets (clusters) and the salesman has to visit exactly one node from every cluster. In this paper we described six distinct formulations of the GTSP as an integer programming. Apart from the standard formulations all the new formulations that we describe are 'compact' in the sense that the number of constraints and variables is a polynomial function of the number of nodes in the problem. In order to provide compact formulations for the GTSP we used two approaches using auxiliary flow variables beyond the natural binary edge and node variables and the second one by distinguishing between global and local variables. Comparisons of the polytopes corresponding to their linear relaxations are established.},

abstract = {It has been observed by many people that a striking number of quite diverse mathematical problems can be formulated as problems in integer programming, that is, linear programming problems in which some or all of the variables are required to assume integral values. This fact is rendered quite interesting by recent research on such problems, notably by R. E. Gomory [2, 3], which gives promise of yielding efficient computational techniques for their solution. The present paper provides yet another example of the versatility of integer programming as a mathematical modeling device by representing a generalization of the well-known “Travelling Salesman Problem” in integer programming terms. The authors have developed several such models, of which the one presented here is the most efficient in terms of generality, number of variables, and number of constraints. This model is due to the second author [4] and was presented briefly at the Symposium on Combinatorial Problems held at Princeton University, April 1960, sponsored by SIAM and IBM. The problem treated is: (1) A salesman is required to visit each of n cities, indexed by 1, … , n. He leaves from a “base city” indexed by 0, visits each of the n other cities exactly once, and returns to city 0. During his travels he must return to 0 exactly t times, including his final return (here t may be allowed to vary), and he must visit no more than p cities in one tour. (By a tour we mean a succession of visits to cities without stopping at city 0.) It is required to find such an itinerary which minimizes the total distance traveled by the salesman.Note that if t is fixed, then for the problem to have a solution we must have tp ≧ n. For t = 1, p ≧ n, we have the standard traveling salesman problem.Let dij (i ≠ j = 0, 1, … , n) be the distance covered in traveling from city i to city j. The following integer programming problem will be shown to be equivalent to (1): (2) Minimize the linear form ∑0≦i≠j≦n∑ dijxij over the set determined by the relations ∑ni=0i≠j xij = 1 (j = 1, … , n) ∑nj=0j≠i xij = 1 (i = 1, … , n) ui - uj + pxij ≦ p - 1 (1 ≦ i ≠ j ≦ n) where the xij are non-negative integers and the ui (i = 1, …, n) are arbitrary real numbers. (We shall see that it is permissible to restrict the ui to be non-negative integers as well.)If t is fixed it is necessary to add the additional relation: ∑nu=1 xi0 = t Note that the constraints require that xij = 0 or 1, so that a natural correspondence between these two problems exists if the xij are interpreted as follows: The salesman proceeds from city i to city j if and only if xij = 1. Under this correspondence the form to be minimized in (2) is the total distance to be traveled by the salesman in (1), so the burden of proof is to show that the two feasible sets correspond; i.e., a feasible solution to (2) has xij which do define a legitimate itinerary in (1), and, conversely a legitimate itinerary in (1) defines xij, which, together with appropriate ui, satisfy the constraints of (2).Consider a feasible solution to (2).The number of returns to city 0 is given by ∑ni=1 xi0. The constraints of the form ∑ xij = 1, all xij non-negative integers, represent the conditions that each city (other than zero) is visited exactly once. The ui play a role similar to node potentials in a network and the inequalities involving them serve to eliminate tours that do not begin and end at city 0 and tours that visit more than p cities. Consider any xr0r1 = 1 (r1 ≠ 0). There exists a unique r2 such that xr1r2 = 1. Unless r2 = 0, there is a unique r3 with xr2r3 = 1. We proceed in this fashion until some rj = 0. This must happen since the alternative is that at some point we reach an rk = rj, j + 1 < k. Since none of the r's are zero we have uri - uri + 1 + pxriri + 1 ≦ p - 1 or uri - uri + 1 ≦ - 1. Summing from i = j to k - 1, we have urj - urk = 0 ≦ j + 1 - k, which is a contradiction. Thus all tours include city 0. It remains to observe that no tours is of length greater than p. Suppose such a tour exists, x0r1 , xr1r2 , … , xrprp+1 = 1 with all ri ≠ 0. Then, as before, ur1 - urp+1 ≦ - p or urp+1 - ur1 ≧ p.But we have urp+1 - ur1 + pxrp+1r1 ≦ p - 1 or urp+1 - ur1 ≦ p (1 - xrp+1r1) - 1 ≦ p - 1, which is a contradiction.Conversely, if the xij correspond to a legitimate itinerary, it is clear that the ui can be adjusted so that ui = j if city i is the jth city visited in the tour which includes city i, for we then have ui - uj = - 1 if xij = 1, and always ui - uj ≦ p - 1.The above integer program involves n2 + n constraints (if t is not fixed) in n2 + 2n variables. Since the inequality form of constraint is fundamental for integer programming calculations, one may eliminate 2n variables, say the xi0 and x0j, by means of the equation constraints and produce an equivalent problem with n2 + n inequalities and n2 variables.The currently known integer programming procedures are sufficiently regular in their behavior to cast doubt on the heuristic value of machine experiments with our model. However, it seems appropriate to report the results of the five machine experiments we have conducted so far. The solution procedure used was the all-integer algorithm of R. E. Gomory [3] without the ranking procedure he describes.The first three experiments were simple model verification tests on a four-city standard traveling salesman problem with distance matrix [ 20 23 4 30 7 27 25 5 25 3 21 26 ]The first experiment was with a model, now obsolete, using roughly twice as many constraints and variables as the current model (for this problem, 28 constraints in 21 variables). The machine was halted after 4000 pivot steps had failed to produce a solution.The second experiment used the earlier model with the xi0 and x0j eliminated, resulting in a 28-constraint, 15-variable problem. Here the machine produced the optimal solution in 41 pivot steps.The third experiment used the current formulation with the xi0 and x0j eliminated, yielding 13 constraints and 9 variables. The optimal solution was reached in 7 pivot steps.The fourth and fifth experiments were used on a standard ten-city problem, due to Barachet, solved by Dantzig, Johnson and Fulkerson [1]. The current formulation was used, yielding 91 constraints in 81 variables. The fifth problem differed from the fourth only in that the ordering of the rows was altered to attempt to introduce more favorable pivot choices. In each case the machine was stopped after over 250 pivot steps had failed to produce the solution. In each case the last 100 pivot steps had failed to change the value of the objective function.It seems hopeful that more efficient integer programming procedures now under development will yield a satisfactory algorithmic solution to the traveling salesman problem, when applied to this model. In any case, the model serves to illustrate how problems of this sort may be succinctly formulated in integer programming terms.},
